## Executive Summary

This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of how Indians interact with ChatGPT, revealing **unique AI adoption patterns not documented in global research**. Through direct analysis of 122 real user prompts from 26 Indian users across major cities, we discovered that insights that help us get an early glimpse into how users utilise Chatgpt for personal queries, work related discussions and more.

We will be updating this study when we review the next set of prompts and run our analysis on it so this is kind of completed but also a live working document. 

### Core Insights

1. **Hinglish AI**: Indians talk to ChatGPT in "bilingual AI interaction mode," seamlessly blending Hindi and English in prompts (Sanskrit terms appeared too!)
2. **Trust-Based AI Relationships**: Indians develop deeper personal relationships with AI than any documented global pattern, seeking advice on health, family and intimate life decisions (so many of you have asked ChatGPT what to do with prolonged fever/cough/sinus, how to deal with a heartbreak etc).
3. **Multi-Domain Chats**: Unique "topic-jumping" behaviour where users explore unrelated subjects in single sessions (e.g., sensors‚Üíwine‚Üíhouse design‚Üícoding). This could also be lack of understanding on the context windows but more on this later.
4. **Age No Bar**: Counter to typical patterns, older Indians demonstrate the highest AI interaction sophistication (Noticed people in age 45-55 give very detailed prompts on their medical reports and not use it as Google search which is how I assumed it to be)
5. **Professional AI Integration**: All of them are using ChatGPT at workplace (those who do not have company access to ChatGPT end up using ChatGPT from their phone for work tasks).

- **Evidence**: Natural code-switching in prompts ("ahar, vihar, achar, vichar with respect to sleep")
- **Global Uniqueness**: No comparable bilingual integration documented in global AI usage studies
- **Implication**: Successful AI requires cultural-linguistic understanding, not just translation

### 2. Trust-Based AI Relationships  
**Discovery**: Deepest personal AI integration documented in research
- **Evidence**: Personal health advice seeking, family decision consultation, life guidance queries
- **Cultural Context**: Traditional guru-student relationship model adapted for AI
