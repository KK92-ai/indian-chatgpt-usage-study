Authenticity Over Assumptions

Code-switching is minimal: Only 2% of prompts mix Hindi-English, not the heavy mixing often assumed
Direct, practical tone: Indians use ChatGPT very pragmatically - no excessive politeness or flowery language
Natural imperfection: Real typos like "maesure" and "gaj" create authenticity

Cultural Context Integration

When Indians specify cultural context, it's very specific: "karva chauth", "suji ka chila", "3BHK design"
Price consciousness is real: 18% include budget constraints with Indian currency
Family/social approval matters: References to parents, family functions, workplace acceptance

Prompt Structure DNA

Bimodal distribution: 40% very short (â‰¤10 words), 35% detailed (>25 words)
Question format: 29% use questions, but statements are more common
Context specification: "for Indian men/women", "in Mumbai", "for family" patterns
