## Key Verified Findings

### Statistically Supported Conclusions (Sufficient Sample Sizes)

1. **Age-Based Work Focus Progression**: Clear increase from 25% (18-25) to 43.5% (26-35) to 57.1% (36-45)

2. **Young Adult Mixed Usage**: 18-25 group shows highest experimentation (37.5% mixed usage)

3. **Daily Integration Standard**: 85% overall daily usage indicates mature adoption across all measurable age groups

4. **Geographic-Age Correlation**: 26-35 group concentrates in tech hubs (52.2% in top 3 cities)

### Patterns Requiring Larger Sample Validation

1. **46-55 Age Group Behavior**: Current sample (n=2) insufficient for any conclusions

2. **Geographic Sophistication Differences**: Need larger samples from tier-2/3 cities

3. **Professional vs Personal Integration Depth**: Industry-specific analysis needed

---

## Research Limitations

### Sample Size Constraints
- **46-55 age group**: Only 2 users - **no demographic conclusions possible**
- **Geographic bias**: Urban, educated population overrepresented
- **Professional bias**: LinkedIn network recruitment may skew toward working professionals

### Required Future Validation
- **Age group stratification**: Minimum 15-20 users per age group needed for reliable demographic conclusions
- **Rural/tier-2 city representation**: Current sample likely urban-biased
- **Industry and role-specific analysis**: Professional usage patterns need sectoral breakdown
